# 👋 Hi, I'm Dmytro – Fullstack JS Developer

I'm a junior/strong junior developer with practical experience in full-cycle team projects, academic training, and a strong focus on clean, maintainable code. My core stack includes **JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB**.

## 🚀 What I bring to the table

- Solid foundation in frontend and backend development
- Experience leading a frontend team and contributing to backend logic
- Invited to join a volunteer team to develop a Next.js application for an external client.  
  Although the project has been put on hold, this experience solidified my readiness to contribute to similar real-world projects
- Strong communication, time management, and async teamwork skills
- Passion for clean repo structure, naming conventions, and pragmatic workflows

## 🧠 Currently focused on

- Expanding backend skills (Python/Django) through an online course to complement my JS-based fullstack foundation
- Seeking opportunities to apply my JS/TS stack in MVP-stage projects and grow through hands-on experience
